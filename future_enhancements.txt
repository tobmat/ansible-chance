Future enhancements:

- Build in private VPC
- Add auto-scaling group / build instances across multiple AZs
- Add application load balancer
- Register Domain to route53
- Add SSL cert
- Build EC2 instances on private network
  - Build linux jump to run ansible playbooks, use role-based access instead of aws keys
- Work with developers to build CI/CD pipeline
- Determine best plan to handle monitoring, logging and alerting

Ansible enhancements:
- Create vault file for aws creds if still needed
- Make all steps idempotent 
- Make code reusable for multiple apps
- cleanup role tasks
  - use with_items for repetitve modules
  - replace hard-coded items with variables 
- create tasks to tear-down infra

Other considerations based on app requirements:
- Build app using Elastic Beanstalk
- Build app using Lambda 
- Bake initial configuration steps into image to speed up deployment
